# The Gratitude Ledger: A Post-Monetary Impact Economy

## Whitepaper v1.0

**Abstract:** This paper introduces Thank You Tokens (TYT), a cryptographically-secured gratitude economy designed to measure and recognize humanitarian impact without creating perverse monetary incentives. By decoupling financial value from social merit, the system creates a reputation infrastructure for a post-scarcity world where universal basic income is widespread and traditional career paths centered on survival economics become obsolete.

---

### Executive Summary

The Thank You Token system represents more than a technical innovation in reputation systems. It's a foundational infrastructure for a world where survival is guaranteed but meaning must be chosen.

**The Core Insight:**

Most systems fail because they tie recognition to control - money, power, access. When recognition becomes a scarce resource, it becomes corrupted by the same dynamics that corrupt monetary systems: hoarding, inequality, exploitation.

TYT succeeds by making recognition abundant, verifiable, and intrinsically meaningful. It cannot be hoarded because hoarding makes you irrelevant. It cannot be sold because it cannot be transferred. It cannot be faked because fraud reveals itself algorithmically.

Most charity systems fail at a fundamental level: they tie recognition to money raised rather than impact delivered. This creates perverse incentives where marketing prowess supersedes genuine need-meeting, and where gaming the system becomes more profitable than serving communities.

In a world with universal basic income, humanity will face its greatest challenge and opportunity: what do we do when we don't have to do anything?

The Thank You Token (TYT) system solves this by introducing a **non-transferable, cryptographically-signed gratitude artifact** that can only be issued by verified partners, distributors, and beneficiaries. The system is designed to be:

* **Intrinsically worthless** (no monetary value, cannot be sold)

* **Unfarmable** (rate-limited by real-world logistics)

* **Collusion-resistant** (graph analysis detects reciprocal gaming)

* **Anti-hoarding** (entropy decay punishes stagnation)

* **Transparent** (open algorithms, auditable flows)

The result is not a points system or a gamified economy, but a **gratitude ledger** that creates career paths in humanitarian impact without the corrupting influence of financial incentives.

---

### The Problem: Why Traditional Charity Metrics Fail

#### The Donation Paradox

Traditional charity success is measured by:

* Dollars raised

* Number of donors

* Marketing reach

* Brand recognition

None of these measure actual impact. They measure fundraising capability.

#### Perverse Incentive Structures

When recognition follows money:

1. **Marketing displaces mission** - Resources shift from aid delivery to donor acquisition

2. **Need becomes performance** - Beneficiaries are incentivized to appear more desperate

3. **Competition replaces collaboration** - Organizations compete for the same donor pool

4. **Measurement becomes impossible** - Impact is secondary to impression

#### The Coming Crisis: Post-Scarcity Without Purpose

As automation, AI, and economic policy move toward guaranteed income systems, humanity faces a new challenge: **how do people find meaning when survival is guaranteed?**

Traditional answers:

* Volunteer work (undervalued)

* Creative pursuits (oversaturated)

* Service roles (status-poor)

The missing infrastructure: **A way to build reputation through impact that creates genuine career paths without financial corruption.**

---

### Core Concept: The Thank You Token (TYT)

#### Definition

A **Thank You Token (TYT)** is a one-time, human-issued, cryptographically-signed gratitude artifact representing that real human need was met in a meaningful way.

#### Fundamental Properties

1. **No monetary value** - Cannot be exchanged for goods, services, or currency

2. **Non-transferable** - Cryptographically bound to recipient identity

3. **Unidirectional** - Flows only from verified issuers to recipients

4. **Permanent** - Cannot be revoked, edited, or destroyed

5. **Transparent** - Aggregate data publicly auditable

#### Issuance Authority

TYTs can only be issued by:

**Tier 1: Institutional Issuers**

* Shelters, food banks, hospitals, established NGOs

* Verified through multi-step physical auditing

* Receive token allocation based on operational capacity

**Tier 2: Authorized Distributors**

* Field workers who receive token bundles from institutions

* Distribute resources and issue tokens at point of impact

* Earn tokens themselves for distribution activity

**Tier 3: Beneficiary Issuers** (limited scope)

* Kiosk systems in verified locations

* Biometric-limited with strict caps

* Emergency-only contexts

---

### Threat Model: How Greed Tries to Break It

#### Vector 1: Fake Need Farming

**Attack Vector:**\
Bad actors pretend to be in distress to harvest tokens, scaling fake operations to accumulate recognition.

**Defensive Architecture:**

_Rate-Limited Supply_

* Issuers receive token allocations based on verified operational capacity

* Allocation formula: `tokens = f(historical_throughput, audit_score, regional_need_index)`

_Activity Proof Requirements_

* Geo-structured photo submissions (coarse location, no PII)

* Inventory movement logs (inputs vs. distributions)

* Third-party spot audits (randomized)

_Statistical Anomaly Detection_

* High-volume issuers trigger automatic review

* Improbable throughput patterns flagged

* Geographic impossibility detection

**Result:** Fake beneficiaries can't scale because issuers are bottlenecked by real-world logistics and random audits.

---

#### Vector 2: Collusion Rings

**Attack Vector:**\
Two or more parties create reciprocal token-farming arrangements: "You give me tokens, I'll give you tokens."

**Defensive Architecture:**

_Directional Token Flow_

* Tokens flow only from authorized issuers to recipients

* Recipients cannot issue tokens without separate issuer authorization

* No peer-to-peer token generation

_Graph Analysis Engine_

* System maintains directed acyclic graph (DAG) of all token flows

* Cycles automatically detected and flagged

* Reciprocity patterns analyzed over time windows

* Clustering algorithms identify suspicious network structures

_Probabilistic Impossibility Detection_

* If A issues to B and B issues to A within similar timeframes

* If clusters show circular gratitude patterns

* System weight of both parties automatically diminishes

**Result:** No loops = no mutual farming. Collusion becomes algorithmically detectable and self-defeating.

---

#### Vector 3: Token Black Markets

**Attack Vector:**\
Secondary markets emerge where people buy and sell TYTs or the accounts that hold them.

**Defensive Architecture:**

_Hard Cryptographic Binding_\
Each token contains:

```
Token = {
  issuer_public_key,
  recipient_pseudonym_hash,
  timestamp_unix,
  geo_region_code,
  impact_class,
  nonce,
  issuer_signature,
  audit_hash
}
```

_Non-Transferability_

* Recipient pseudonym derived from biometric or hardware-backed identity

* Cannot be reassigned or moved

* Ownership cryptographically enforced at protocol level

_Account Recovery Protocols_

* Lost access requires multi-party recovery with cooling-off period

* Prevents account selling by making transfers slow and auditable

* Recovery requires proof of identity matching original signup

**Result:** Resale economics collapse when ownership cannot be transferred. Markets can't form around non-transferable assets.

---

#### Vector 4: Hoarding Behavior

**Attack Vector:**\
Individuals minimize risk by avoiding impact activities while maintaining existing token counts, creating stagnation.

**Defensive Architecture:**

_Entropy-Based Decay_

* Accounts with no outbound distribution activity gradually lose visibility weight

* Not punitive: tokens remain, but system influence diminishes

* Formula: `visibility_weight = base_tokens * activity_coefficient * time_decay`

_Reciprocity Multipliers_

* Distributors who actively give tokens receive boosted system weight

* Distribution activity > collection activity in scoring

* Creates incentive for continued engagement

_Decay Curve Design_

```
Weight diminishes on sigmoid curve:
- 0-3 months inactivity: 100% weight
- 3-6 months: 95% weight
- 6-12 months: 80% weight
- 12-24 months: 50% weight
- 24+ months: 25% weight floor
```

**Result:** Hoarding = irrelevance. System gamifies generosity over accumulation.

---

#### Vector 5: Manufactured Scarcity

**Attack Vector:**\
Issuers artificially withhold tokens to make their tokens appear more valuable through scarcity.

**Defensive Architecture:**

_Benchmarking Against Need_

* Issuers evaluated against regional need indices

* Expected throughput calculated from operational capacity

* Under-issuance triggers trust score penalties

_Transparency Requirements_

* Issuers must publish aggregate distribution statistics

* Large variance between capacity and issuance flagged

* Community can see and question under-performing partners

_Dynamic Trust Weighting_

* Issuer tokens carry weight based on their trust score

* Under-issuing reduces the future weight of all their tokens

* Creates incentive for maximum, honest distribution

**Result:** Manufactured scarcity backfires by reducing system authority and token weight.

---

#### Vector 6: Fake Distribution Networks

**Attack Vector:**\
Bad actors create fraudulent "partner organizations" to gain issuance privileges.

**Defensive Architecture:**

_Multi-Stage Verification_

1. **Physical Address Verification** - Must have real operational location

2. **On-Site Seals** - Tamper-evident physical markers at location

3. **Third-Party Onboarding Audits** - Independent verification before activation

4. **Probationary Period** - Limited token allocation for first 6 months

5. **Random Blind Audits** - Unannounced site visits throughout lifecycle

_Operational Proof Requirements_

* Photo documentation of facility

* Utility bills and lease/ownership documentation

* Registration with local authorities

* References from existing partners

* Beneficiary interviews (anonymized)

_Throttling Mechanisms_

* New partners receive minimal allocation

* Allocation increases only with verified distribution history

* Fraudulent partners detected before scaling

**Result:** Fake networks can't achieve scale without massive investment in fake infrastructure, making fraud economically irrational.

---

#### Vector 7: Performative Help Farming

**Attack Vector:**\
Individuals perform shallow, symbolic acts for easy tokens rather than substantive impact.

**Defensive Architecture:**

_Tiered Impact Classification_\
Issuers can mark tokens with impact class:

* **Emergency Impact** (highest weight) - Life-preserving interventions

* **Recovery Impact** (high weight) - Sustained support during rebuilding

* **Maintenance Impact** (medium weight) - Ongoing stability support

* **Community Impact** (base weight) - General volunteer service

_Issuer Discretion_

* Only issuers can assign impact class

* Classification based on context and severity

* High-impact tokens require additional justification

_Weighted Scoring_

* System scoring weighs tokens by impact class

* Shallow activities receive lower system weight

* True impact stands out in reputation calculations

**Result:** Low-impact activities are recognized but don't dominate reputation algorithms.

---

#### Vector 8: Platform Capture

**Attack Vector:**\
The system itself becomes corrupted, either by administrators or external forces, turning it into a surveillance or social credit system.

**Defensive Architecture:**

_Open Algorithm Governance_

* Core scoring algorithms published under open license

* Community governance over algorithm changes

* Major changes require supermajority approval

_Cryptographic Commitment_

* Hash of current algorithm posted to blockchain/transparency log

* Any deviation from committed algorithm publicly detectable

* Users can verify they're running against committed algorithm

_Privacy Preserving Architecture_

* User identities encrypted at rest

* Only pseudonyms visible in public graphs

* Zero-knowledge proofs enable verification without exposure

  * "This account is in top 1% of impact" (provable without revealing identity)

  * "This account has distributed in 5+ regions" (provable without revealing which)

_Decentralization Options_

* Architecture designed to support federated deployment

* No single point of failure or control

* Exit rights: users can export their tokens to alternate implementations

**Result:** Platform capture becomes detectable and migratable. Users maintain sovereignty.

### System Architecture

#### Token Structure Specification

```
TYT_Token {
  // Identity & Provenance
  issuer_id: PublicKey              // Issuer's public key
  recipient_pseudonym: Hash          // SHA-256 of recipient identity

  // Context & Classification
  timestamp: UnixTimestamp           // Issuance time
  geo_region: CoarseRegionCode       // Regional context (not precise location)
  impact_class: Enum                 // Emergency/Recovery/Sustained/Community

  // Uniqueness & Security
  nonce: RandomBytes                 // Prevents replay attacks
  issuer_signature: Signature        // Cryptographic proof
  audit_hash: Hash                   // Tamper detection

  // Optional Metadata (encrypted)
  narrative: EncryptedText           // Story/context (optional)
  resource_type: Enum                // Food/Shelter/Medical/Education/etc
}
```

#### Issuer Authorization Model

**Institutional Issuers (Tier 1)**

Verification requirements:

* Legal registration documentation

* Physical facility inspection

* Financial transparency (demonstrate operational legitimacy)

* Reference checks from beneficiaries/community

* Operational history (minimum 6 months preferred)

Token allocation formula:

```
allocation = base_capacity
             × region_need_multiplier
             × historical_performance
             × audit_score
```

Ongoing requirements:

* Quarterly impact reports

* Annual re-verification

* Random field audits (minimum 2 per year)

* Maintaining operational transparency

**Authorized Distributors (Tier 2)**

Authorization requirements:

* Nomination by Tier 1 issuer

* Background verification

* Training completion

* Probationary period with supervision

Token bundle system:

* Distributors receive token bundles from sponsoring institution

* Each token in bundle tied to specific resource type

* Distribution events require geolocation confirmation

* Distributors earn tokens for distribution activity itself

**Beneficiary Issuers (Tier 3)**

Limited deployment in specific contexts:

* Biometric kiosks in verified shelters

* Emergency check-in systems in disaster zones

* Healthcare service confirmation terminals

Strict limitations:

* Capped tokens per time period

* Single-use per beneficiary per location

* Cannot accumulate issuer privileges

* Audit trail for every issuance

#### Reputation Scoring Algorithm

**Core Principle:** Impact, not accumulation.

```
Reputation Score = f(
  token_count,                    // Base activity
  token_weights,                  // Impact classification
  distribution_activity,          // Giving > receiving multiplier
  source_diversity,               // Breadth of impact
  temporal_consistency,           // Sustained vs. sporadic
  network_position,               // Non-circular, outward-facing
  issuer_trust_scores,            // Quality of issuing partners
  entropy_coefficient,            // Anti-hoarding penalty
  time_decay_factor              // Recent activity weighted higher
)
```

**Key Design Choices:**

_Non-Linear Scaling_

* Diminishing returns on token count

* Prevents "whale" dynamics

* 1,000 tokens ≠ 10× better than 100 tokens

_Distribution Multiplier_

* Distributors receive amplified weight

* Giving tokens worth more than receiving

* Encourages circulation over accumulation

_Source Diversity Premium_

* Tokens from diverse issuers > tokens from single source

* Prevents capture by single institution

* Rewards broad community impact

_Recency Weighting_

* Recent activity > historical activity

* Keeps reputation current

* Reflects present commitment

#### Graph Analysis & Fraud Detection

**Real-Time Monitoring:**

_Cycle Detection_

* Tarjan's algorithm for strongly connected components

* Any cycles in directed graph flagged immediately

* Penalties automatically applied to cycle participants

_Anomaly Patterns_

* Statistical impossibilities (geographic, temporal)

* Improbable throughput rates

* Network clustering indicative of collusion

* Sudden behavioral changes

_Machine Learning Models_

* Trained on legitimate vs. fraudulent patterns

* Continuously updated with new attack vectors

* Probabilistic fraud scoring

* Human review for edge cases

**Transparency Layer:**

All fraud detection algorithms published openly:

* Community can audit detection logic

* False positive appeals process

* Continuous improvement based on community feedback

### Economic Game Theory Analysis

#### Why Traditional Points Systems Fail

Most reputation systems collapse because they create **extractive equilibria**:

* **Zero-sum dynamics** - Your gain is my loss, competition dominates

* **Wealth concentration** - Power laws emerge, rich get richer

* **Market formation** - Secondary markets emerge immediately

* **Incentive corruption** - System gaming becomes more profitable than intended behavior

#### TYT's Anti-Greed Properties

**Non-Zero-Sum Foundation**

* One person's tokens don't diminish another's

* Helping others increases total system value

* Cooperation > competition in scoring

**Anti-Concentration Mechanisms**

* Non-linear returns prevent whales

* Distribution activity valued over collection

* No inheritance, no transfers, no sales

**Market Impossibility**

* Non-transferability kills secondary markets

* No price discovery possible

* Cannot be collateralized

**Intrinsic Value Alignment**

* System designed so gaming reveals itself

* Authentic behavior = optimal strategy

* Fraud is algorithmically expensive

#### Nash Equilibrium Analysis

**Defect Strategy (Gaming the System):**

* Requires collusion (detectable)

* Requires fake infrastructure (expensive)

* Requires sustained deception (statistically improbable)

* Results in algorithmic irrelevance (self-defeating)

**Cooperate Strategy (Authentic Impact):**

* Low coordination cost

* Scales naturally with real operations

* Statistically consistent with legitimate patterns

* Accumulates reputation efficiently

**Result:** Authentic cooperation is the dominant strategy. Gaming is irrational.

#### Network Effects

**Positive Reinforcement:**

* More participants → more verification touchpoints

* More issuers → harder to game any single relationship

* More distributors → broader geographic coverage

* More visibility → stronger career path signals

**Quality Convergence:**

* Bad actors revealed by network inconsistency

* Good actors validated by network consistency

* System becomes self-purifying at scale

---

### Implementation Considerations

#### Technical Infrastructure

**Blockchain vs. Centralized Database:**

_Arguments for Blockchain:_

* Immutability guarantees

* Decentralization prevents capture

* Public auditability built-in

* Censorship resistance

_Arguments Against:_

* Scalability limitations

* Energy concerns (if proof-of-work)

* Complexity barriers for users

* Governance challenges

_Recommended Hybrid:_

* Core token registry on public blockchain (Ethereum L2, Polygon, etc.)

* Graph analysis and reputation scoring in performant centralized systems

* Regular merkle root commitments from centralized systems to blockchain

* Users can verify their data against blockchain checkpoints

**Privacy Architecture:**

_Identity Management:_

* Zero-knowledge identity proofs (zk-SNARKs)

* Users prove attributes without revealing identity

* "Prove you have 500+ tokens without revealing count"

* "Prove you distributed in Asia without revealing precise location"

_Data Minimization:_

* Collect only essential fields

* Aggregate before publication

* Individual transactions never publicly linkable to real identity

* Issuer side stores private details, public chain stores only hashes

**API & Integration Layer:**

Partner organizations need:

* Simple token issuance API

* Mobile-first interfaces

* Offline-capable (sync when connectivity available)

* Multi-language support

* Accessibility compliance

#### Legal & Regulatory Considerations

**Jurisdictional Questions:**

_Is TYT a security?_

* No: no expectation of profit, no monetary value

* But: regulatory landscape varies by jurisdiction

* Recommendation: legal opinion in target markets

_Data protection compliance:_

* GDPR: right to erasure conflicts with immutability

  * Solution: encrypt personal data, store decryption keys separately

  * Users can destroy keys (effectively erasing their linkage)

* CCPA, other privacy regulations

  * Solution: minimize personal data collection at protocol level

_Tax implications:_

* TYTs have no monetary value → not taxable income

* But: if reputation enables job opportunities, indirect economic benefit

* Recommendation: clear guidance that TYTs are non-financial recognition

**Governance Structure:**

_Foundation Model:_

* Non-profit foundation controls core protocol

* Multi-stakeholder board (partners, distributors, beneficiaries, technologists)

* Democratic governance over major changes

* Transparent financial operations

_Sustainability Funding:_

* Optional partner subscription fees (not required, creates sustainability)

* Grant funding from charitable foundations

* Government partnerships in relevant contexts

* Never advertising, never selling user data

#### Rollout Strategy

**Phase 1: Pilot (Months 0-6)**

* Single geographic region

* 5-10 established partner organizations

* 50-100 authorized distributors

* Goal: Prove concept, refine UX, identify attacks

**Phase 2: Regional Expansion (Months 6-18)**

* Expand to 3-5 regions

* 50+ partner organizations

* 500+ distributors

* Goal: Test scaling, cross-region dynamics, diverse contexts

**Phase 3: Open Platform (Months 18-36)**

* Open applications for new partners

* Federated deployment options

* API ecosystem for third-party tools

* Goal: Become infrastructure layer

**Phase 4: Maturity (Years 3+)**

* Global presence

* Recognized as career-path signal

* Integration with hiring, volunteering, education systems

* Goal: New social infrastructure

### Comparison to Existing Systems

#### Social Credit Systems (China)

**Similarities:** Reputation tracking, behavioral incentives

**Critical Differences:**

* **TYT is voluntary** - No one must participate

* **No punishment mechanisms** - Only recognition, never penalty

* **Transparent algorithms** - Community governance, not state control

* **Privacy preserving** - Pseudonymous, not surveillance

* **Single domain** - Impact only, not social control

**Verdict:** Superficially similar, fundamentally opposite in purpose and architecture.

#### Blockchain Reputation Systems (Gitcoin, POAP, etc.)

**Similarities:** Token-based recognition, crypto infrastructure

**Critical Differences:**

* **Non-transferable** - Cannot sell or trade TYTs

* **Rate-limited by reality** - Can't just mint tokens

* **Impact-focused** - Not arbitrary achievements

* **Verified issuers** - Not open to anyone

**Verdict:** Shares technical DNA, but TYT's non-transferability and real-world verification create different economics.

#### Traditional Volunteer Hours Tracking

**Similarities:** Measuring service contributions

**Critical Differences:**

* **Quality over quantity** - Impact class matters, not just hours

* **Cryptographically verifiable** - Can't falsify records

* **Portable** - Not siloed within single organization

* **Network effects** - Cross-organization reputation

**Verdict:** TYT is "volunteer hours 2.0" with modern cryptographic verification and portability.

#### LinkedIn Endorsements

**Similarities:** Social recognition, career signaling

**Critical Differences:**

* **Real-world verification** - Not just peer claims

* **Fraud-resistant** - Can't fake institutional backing

### Conclusion: Building Post-Scarcity Heroism

The Thank You Token system represents more than a technical innovation in reputation systems. It's a foundational infrastructure for a world where survival is guaranteed but meaning must be chosen.

**The Core Insight:**

Most systems fail because they tie recognition to control - money, power, access. When recognition becomes a scarce resource, it becomes corrupted by the same dynamics that corrupt monetary systems: hoarding, inequality, exploitation.

TYT succeeds by making recognition abundant, verifiable, and intrinsically meaningful. It cannot be hoarded because hoarding makes you irrelevant. It cannot be sold because it cannot be transferred. It cannot be faked because fraud reveals itself algorithmically.

**The Promise:**

In a world with universal basic income, humanity will face its greatest challenge and opportunity: what do we do when we don't have to do anything?

The answer cannot be hedonism or nihilism. It must be heroism - but a new kind of heroism.

Not heroism born from desperation, where helping others is transactional survival.

Not heroism corrupted by money, where impact is secondary to optics.

But **post-scarcity heroism**: helping because it's meaningful, because it's seen, because it builds something real - a reputation of impact that opens doors, creates opportunities, and signals to the world: this person makes a difference.

**The Challenge:**

This system will face attacks. Bad actors will try to game it. Critics will point out edge cases. Skeptics will doubt whether recognition without money can motivate.

But the architecture anticipates these attacks. The game theory favors authenticity. And the human need for meaningful recognition is as old as humanity itself.

**The Invitation:**

This whitepaper is not the final word. It's the beginning of a conversation.

We invite:

* **Technologists** to refine the architecture

* **Economists** to stress-test the game theory

* **Humanitarian organizations** to pilot the system

* **Philosophers** to challenge the assumptions

* **Communities** to shape the governance

Because the gratitude ledger isn't just software. It's social infrastructure for a better future.

A future where impact matters more than income.

Where generosity is seen and valued.

Where career paths exist for those who choose to serve.

Where reputation is earned through lived impact, not inherited wealth or performative charity.

**This is the future we can build together.**

**Graph Analysis Algorithm** (Pseudocode)

```python
def detect_fraud_patterns(graph):
    """
    Analyzes token flow graph for fraud indicators
    """

    # Detect cycles (reciprocal farming)
    cycles = tarjan_scc(graph)
    for cycle in cycles:
        if len(cycle) > 1:
            flag_for_review(cycle, "Reciprocal pattern detected")

    # Detect statistical anomalies
    for node in graph.nodes:
        if improbable_velocity(node):
            flag_for_review(node, "Impossible geographic movement")
        if improbable_volume(node):
            flag_for_review(node, "Suspicious throughput rate")

    # Detect clustering (collusion networks)
    clusters = community_detection(graph)
    for cluster in clusters:
        if suspicious_density(cluster):
            flag_for_review(cluster, "Possible collusion network")

    return fraud_scores
```

**Reputation Calculation** (Pseudocode)

```python
def calculate_reputation(user_id):
    """
    Calculates user reputation score
    """

    tokens = get_user_tokens(user_id)

    # Base score from token count with diminishing returns
    base_score = log(len(tokens) + 1)

    # Weight by impact class
    weighted_score = sum([
        token.weight * IMPACT_MULTIPLIERS[token.impact_class]
        for token in tokens
    ])

    # Distribution bonus
    distribution_activity = get_distribution_count(user_id)
    distribution_multiplier = 1 + (distribution_activity * 0.1)

    # Source diversity
    unique_issuers = len(set([t.issuer for t in tokens]))
    diversity_multiplier = min(1.5, 1 + (unique_issuers * 0.05))

    # Recency decay
    recent_tokens = [t for t in tokens if t.age < 365_DAYS]
    recency_multiplier = len(recent_tokens) / len(tokens)

    # Entropy coefficient (anti-hoarding)
    days_since_activity = days_since_last_distribution(user_id)
    entropy_penalty = entropy_decay_curve(days_since_activity)

    # Network position (non-circular)
    network_score = analyze_network_position(user_id)

    # Issuer trust scores

### Appendix B: Governance Framework

**Foundation Charter** (Draft principles)

1. **Mission Primacy** - Impact measurement, not profit, is core purpose

2. **Multi-Stakeholder Governance** - Partners, distributors, beneficiaries, and technologists have voice

3. **Transparency Default** - Algorithms, finances, and decisions are public

4. **Privacy Protection** - Individual data minimized and protected

5. **Democratic Evolution** - Major changes require community consensus

6. **Anti-Capture Provisions** - No single entity can control the system

7. **Exit Rights** - Users can leave and take their data

8. **Open Source Commitment** - Core code remains open and auditable

**Decision-Making Structure:**

* **Minor Changes** (UI, minor algorithm tweaks): Core team decision

* **Moderate Changes** (scoring adjustments, new features): Board approval

* **Major Changes** (fundamental algorithm changes, governance shifts): Community vote

**Voting Eligibility:**

* Partners: 1 vote per verified organization

* Distributors: 1 vote per active distributor

* Beneficiaries: Representation through partner advocacy

* Users: Advisory input, not binding votes (prevents gaming)

### Appendix C: FAQ

**Q: Isn't this just social credit?**

A: No. Social credit is mandatory, punitive, comprehensive, and state-controlled. TYT is voluntary, recognition-only, impact-specific, and community-governed. You can't be punished for not participating, and it only measures humanitarian contribution, not social compliance.

**Q: What stops people from creating fake beneficiaries?**

A: Issuers are rate-limited by verified operational capacity. To create fake beneficiaries at scale, you'd need fake infrastructure, which is expensive and detectable through random audits. Small-scale fraud is possible but economically irrational.

**Q: Can I sell my tokens?**

A: No. Tokens are cryptographically bound to your identity and cannot be transferred. Any attempt to sell your account would require giving away your identity, which defeats the purpose.

**Q: What if I lose access to my account?**

A: Recovery process requires multi-party verification with cooling-off period. This prevents account trading while allowing legitimate recovery.

**Q: How do you prevent rich people from just paying others to issue them tokens?**

A: Issuer authorization is carefully controlled. You can't just become an issuer by paying. And issuers caught issuing fraudulent tokens lose authorization and all their tokens lose weight retroactively.

**Q: Won't employers just ignore this?**

A: Maybe at first. But the system creates verifiable proof of impact that's currently impossible to demonstrate. As adoption grows, employers seeking mission-driven employees will value this data. It's a bootstrapping challenge, not a fundamental flaw.

**Q: What about privacy? Don't you know everything about me?**

A: No. The system stores only pseudonymous data. We know pseudonym X received tokens, not who X is in real life. Zero-knowledge proofs let you prove attributes without revealing identity.

**Q: How do you make money?**

A: We don't. This is designed as philanthropic infrastructure. Sustainability comes from optional partner subscriptions, grants, and potential government partnerships. Never advertising or data sales.

**Q: Can this work in my country?**

A: That depends on local regulations, but the core design is jurisdiction-agnostic. We'd need legal review for specific contexts, especially around data protection and whether tokens might be considered securities.

**Q: What if someone steals my phone with my tokens?**

A: Tokens require biometric or hardware-backed authentication to prove ownership. Stealing your device doesn't transfer your identity. You can recover your account through multi-party verification.

**Q: This seems complicated. Why not just use volunteer hour tracking?**

A: Because volunteer hours are easy to fake, hard to verify, non-portable, and don't capture impact quality. TYT is verifiable, portable, fraud-resistant, and measures what matters: impact, not just time.
