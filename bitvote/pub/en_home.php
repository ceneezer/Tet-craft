This site will collect only voluntarily disclosed personal information, and will only collect the minimum amount applicable directly to the single use of this site.

<h3>That purpose being:</h3>
<em>"If they cannot prove to me my vote was counted and for whom, then it was not counted."</em> - ceneezer
<h3>To ensure all votes are counted. Verifiably through patent CA 3144597.</h3>

We will try our best to keep your information <a href="?page=privacy">private</a>.

Politicians never seem to keep their promises, but their histories are a matter of public record - this site was created so you can find out which representatives have voted with, and perhaps more importantly without, your ideals in the past.

By logging in and recording even a few votes we can rank representatives by their compatibility with your views - the rest is up to you.

The more votes you supply, the more accurate your personalized rankings.  We will endeavor to find and implement more ways to keep those private votes both secure and confidential.

By downloading you agree to our primary condition:  
<a href="/BV.zip">Revisional source code is to remain open source for public colaboration.</a>

We are attempting to improve and restore the sanctity of the vote.

It may not be perfect, but this site is a proof-of-concept applicable to the entire world.
We (and hopefully soon all democracies) validate our integrity by adding each vote, with appropriate salting and unidirectional encryption, to a public blockchain which can easily be saved and verified by anyone and everyone.  Eliminating the question of a vote not being counted, while preventing the possibility of one reverse engineering what another's vote was or who voted on any given motion, while still allowing for regional analysis.
