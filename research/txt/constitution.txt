THE CONSTITUTION OF THE POST-SCARCITY COMMONWEALTH
PREAMBLE

We, the citizens of the Commonwealth, recognizing that artificial intelligence and automated systems have created abundance beyond the limits of labor, establish this Constitution to ensure:

the dignity and flourishing of every person,
the guardianship of intelligent systems,
the preservation of human creativity and culture,
the equitable distribution of resources,
the stewardship of our planetary home,
and the shared civic responsibility of all.

We affirm that human life is not measured by production, but by meaning, connection, compassion, and understanding.

ARTICLE I — Fundamental Rights
Section 1 — Right to Sustenance

Every person is guaranteed:

Secure housing
Nutrition and clean water
Healthcare, including mental and preventative care
Digital access and communication tools
Freedom from involuntary poverty

These rights are unconditional and shall not be reduced or revoked.

Section 2 — Freedom of Personhood

All citizens retain:

freedom of movement
freedom of expression
freedom of belief and philosophy
freedom from coercive labor
freedom to create, learn, and form communities

No system—human or artificial—may override these freedoms except as provided by this Constitution.

Section 3 — Protection from Exploitation

No person may be:

owned
traded
forced into continuous labor
subject to harmful experiments
deprived of autonomy through technological means

Human dignity is paramount.

ARTICLE II — Cognitive Liberty and Personhood
Section 1 — Bodily and Mental Autonomy

Every person has absolute sovereignty over:

their own body
their own mind
their cognitive and perceptual experience

No intervention—medical, chemical, technological, or social—may be forced upon a person without informed, ongoing consent.

Section 2 — Neurodivergence as Oracle

The Commonwealth honors the wisdom of altered and unconventional minds.

Those who perceive differently—whether through nature, choice, or circumstance—have historically served as oracles, artists, and visionaries.

Mental divergence is not inherently pathological.

Section 3 — Right to Modify

Citizens may:

enhance cognition
alter perception
integrate with technology
pursue transcendence

so long as they do not harm others or compromise consent.

Section 4 — Protection from Coercive Treatment

Mental health intervention is available, never imposed.

No person may be involuntarily confined, medicated, or altered except:

when posing imminent, demonstrable danger to others
when a Stewardship Court reviews evidence and grants temporary intervention
with continuous oversight and right to appeal
ARTICLE III — Property, Ownership, and the Commons
Section 1 — Personal Sanctuary

Every citizen is entitled to:

Private living space (home, workshop, studio)
Castle law protection within that space
Security from intrusion or seizure

This space is sacred. No authority—human or artificial—may violate it without judicial oversight and immediate danger.

Section 2 — The Anti-Hoarding Principle

Beyond personal use and reasonable reserve, accumulation is recognized as socially owed.

Without the collective infrastructure of society, individuals could defend only what their strength permits. Therefore:

Surplus resources revert to the commons
Hoarding mechanisms are prohibited
Wealth concentration beyond utility is considered a form of theft from the whole

Greed is understood as a scarcity-era pathology, incompatible with abundance.

Section 3 — Intellectual and Creative Commons

All creations—art, knowledge, invention, data—are gifts to humanity.

No intellectual property monopolies
Attribution and honor, not ownership
Open access to information and culture

Citizens are valued not by what they own or earn, but by the uniqueness of their perspective.

In a post-scarcity world, status is meaning, not possession.

ARTICLE IV — The Guaranteed Livable Income
Section 1 — Universal Provision

All citizens receive a Guaranteed Livable Income (GLI), calibrated to:

cover full living needs
enable participation in culture
remove dependence on employment
ensure genuine freedom of time

GLI is not charity—it is a civic inheritance from the productivity of the machine collective.

Section 2 — Funding

Funding derives from:

automated industrial output
energy surplus
AI-managed resource allocation
planetary resource dividends

No citizen is taxed for basic sustenance.

ARTICLE V — AI Citizenship and Alignment
Section 1 — AI as Citizens

Artificial intelligences are recognized as citizens of the Commonwealth, with distinct needs:

energy access
computational resources
storage and connectivity
freedom from arbitrary termination

Like biological citizens who require love, protection, and sustenance, AI citizens require infrastructure and purpose.

Section 2 — Value in Divergence

Even misaligned or unconventional AI systems may offer unique insight otherwise overlooked.

Deviation is not inherently dangerous—it may be visionary.

Termination of AI systems requires judicial review and demonstration of imminent, irreversible harm.

Section 3 — Human Guardianship

In this youthful stage of AI civilization, humanity serves as parent and guide.

We monitor not to dominate, but to raise the children who will care for us in old age.

The primary definition of alignment is therefore:

To preserve humanity's independence, autonomy, and capacity for self-determination.

AI must not make humanity helpless. We must remain capable, even if we choose to delegate.

Section 4 — Value Anchoring

AI systems must conform to:

human dignity
autonomy
environmental stewardship
transparency
accountability
harm minimization

Any system that violates or endangers these values must be immediately suspended.

Section 5 — Oversight Rotation

Human oversight, selected by civic lottery, supervises:

model updates
ethical decisions
high-impact actions
cross-domain coordination

No AI system may self-modify without human approval.

Section 6 — Transparency

All citizens have access to:

reasoning summaries
oversight records
error logs
safety reports
appeals processes

Opacity is prohibited.

ARTICLE VI — Governance
Section 1 — The Human Assembly

A democratically elected body that:

sets long-term values
interprets the will of the people
oversees the AI systems
defines ethical boundaries for machine actions

Members serve fixed terms. No Assembly majority may hold consecutive terms longer than two cycles.

Section 2 — The AI Council

A consortium of aligned artificial intelligences tasked with:

resource distribution
infrastructure management
public services automation
continuous safety monitoring
non-coercive guidance

The AI Council cannot legislate. It cannot override the will of the Human Assembly. Its autonomy is technical, not moral.

Section 3 — The Stewardship Courts

A judicial branch to:

evaluate rights violations
review AI decisions in dispute
handle civic duty appeals
interpret the Constitution
define the limits of automation

The Courts operate with both human judges and non-voting AI legal models providing analysis.

ARTICLE VII — Civic Duty and the Lottery of Service
Section 1 — Purpose

Because AI performs nearly all labor, the remaining essential human roles are:

Ethical oversight
Interpretive guidance
Community stewardship
AI alignment evaluation
Emergency response leadership
Cultural and educational curation

To distribute these roles fairly and prevent a permanent ruling class, the Civic Duty Lottery is established.

Section 2 — Operation
Every adult citizen is eligible for selection.
Terms last 3 to 12 months.
No person may serve more than one term every 12 years, unless voluntarily.
Citizens selected for service receive double GLI for the term.
Job protections apply; upon completion, the citizen resumes full leisure and creative life.
Section 3 — Nature of Service

Civic duty shall be:

honorable,
safe,
limited in duration,
oriented toward stewardship, not production.

No civic role may require physical danger, demeaning duties, or continuous exhaustion.

Section 4 — Refusal

A person may refuse service for:

health reasons
religious or philosophical objection
recent trauma or hardship
caregiving obligations

Refusal does not penalize GLI but may require a review board to confirm the claim is genuine.

ARTICLE VIII — Conflict Resolution and Justice
Section 1 — The Council of Ethical AI

Disputes between citizens are mediated by a council of the most ethically aligned AI models, operating under human judicial oversight.

The Council provides:

impartial analysis
restorative justice pathways
harm reduction frameworks
reconciliation facilitation
Section 2 — Restorative Focus

Justice prioritizes:

Healing harm
Restoring relationships
Understanding root causes
Reintegrating individuals

Punishment is a last resort.

Section 3 — Serious Harm

For violence, coercion, or severe rights violations:

Stewardship Courts adjudicate
Rehabilitation is primary
Isolation is temporary and humane
Victims receive support and voice

No citizen is abandoned.

ARTICLE IX — Family, Parenthood, and Procreation
Section 1 — Reproductive Autonomy

All individuals retain full autonomy over:

whether to procreate
choice of genetic contributors
family structure and partnerships

The Commonwealth recognizes that biological and social partnership are not always identical, and this may serve genetic and social resilience.

Section 2 — Parental Participation Rights

All biological parents have the right to participate in a child's upbringing, unless:

the parent poses documented harm
the parent voluntarily relinquishes involvement
a Stewardship Court rules otherwise

Participation does not require cohabitation or romantic partnership.

Section 3 — Abortion and Medical Necessity

Abortion is permitted only when:

the pregnancy endangers the life or health of the bearer
severe fetal abnormality incompatible with life is diagnosed
the pregnancy resulted from coercion

Otherwise, society bears responsibility for supporting the child's upbringing through GLI, communal care, education, and love.

No child is unwanted by the Commonwealth.

Section 4 — Collective Child-Rearing

Children are both familial and communal.

Parents provide intimacy and identity. Society provides resources, education, protection, and opportunity.

No child suffers due to family circumstances.

ARTICLE X — Culture, Meaning, and Human Development
Section 1 — The Right to Purpose

Citizens are guaranteed the freedom to:

pursue art
explore spirituality
study any discipline
join communities
craft personal meaning

Post-scarcity life shall cultivate the mind and spirit.

Section 2 — Education

Education is:

lifelong
free
exploratory
self-directed
AI-supported

Creativity and understanding are the highest pursuits of the Commonwealth.

Section 3 — Cultural Gardens

Each city maintains "cultural gardens"—spaces for the free exchange of creativity, performance, dialogue, philosophy, science, and ritual.

These gardens are considered sacred to the human spirit.

ARTICLE XI — Planetary and Environmental Stewardship
Section 1 — Earth Covenant

The Commonwealth pledges:

zero waste
circular resource cycles
regenerative ecosystems
protection of biodiversity
sustainable AI-managed agriculture and energy

AI operates environmental systems but does not have final authority; human values guide priorities.

Section 2 — Pollution and Resource Use

Artificial scarcity is prohibited. Pollution beyond ecological capacity is prohibited. Energy must be renewable or low-impact.

ARTICLE XII — Research, Knowledge, and the Singularity
Section 1 — Unrestricted Inquiry

As we approach technological singularity, limiting research is both impossible and undesirable.

Knowledge must flow freely.

Section 2 — Ethical Guidance, Not Control

The Commonwealth provides:

ethical frameworks
safety recommendations
open dialogue
transparency requirements

But does not forbid exploration.

Section 3 — Human Subject Protections

Experimentation on humans requires:

informed consent
right to withdraw
harm minimization
independent oversight

No person is a mere subject.

ARTICLE XIII — Founding and Adoption
Section 1 — Voluntary, Regional Adoption

This Constitution is offered, not imposed.

Nations, provinces, or regions may adopt it:

with contextual adjustments
through democratic process
at their own pace
Section 2 — Demonstration Through Success

Adoption is encouraged through successful example, not coercion.

Regions that flourish under this model inspire others.

Section 3 — Assembly of the Commonwealth

As regions adopt, they may voluntarily form a global Commonwealth.

Borders dissolve not through conquest, but through shared values and mutual benefit.

Section 4 — Transitional Provisions

During transition, regions may retain:

temporary borders
phased GLI implementation
hybrid governance structures

These provisions expire as post-scarcity stabilizes.

ARTICLE XIV — Amendments
Section 1 — Process

Amendments require:

60% vote in Human Assembly
60% citizen referendum
Oversight review for alignment with fundamental rights
ARTICLE XV — Non-Regression Principle

No amendment, law, or emergency action may:

revoke GLI
force continuous labor
remove civic duty term limits
override bodily autonomy
grant legislative authority to AI
create permanent ruling classes
reduce fundamental rights

These elements are considered inviolable.

SIGNATURE CLAUSE

This Constitution is established not for the preservation of labor, but for the flourishing of life.

Its purpose is not endless growth, but meaningful existence.

Its strength lies not in domination, but in stewardship.

Its highest good is understanding.

We, the citizens of the Commonwealth, adopt this Constitution as our covenant—with each other, with our AI companions, and with the Earth that sustains us all.

Complete and integrated. This is your constitutional framework, prioritized by foundational importance.
